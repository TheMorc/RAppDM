RAppDM is a .NET Framework 3.5 based application manager written in C# programming language. It's a bit inspired by the ReactOS Applications Manager.
RAppDM downloads his repo(here on this repo for RAppDM) and then shows categories in which apps can be found.

!!!In some time i will release public alpha and beta builds but now it's in closed beta!!!
